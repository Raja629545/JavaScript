# Learn JavaScript
Hi, I am Rajesh Halder, a MCA student in the  Department of the Computer Application at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT). I started to learn JavaScript. So, I created this repository to share whatever I have learned and also to provide some projects along with my learning journey. If you want to contribute or can optimize/add any code further, then please create a pull request.

I learned javascript from Hitesh Choudhary Sir, who has wonderfull teaching skill and breakdown complex concepts in very easy way.
